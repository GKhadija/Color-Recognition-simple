# Color-Recognition-simple
Color Recognition with using opencv and numpy

I used simple color recognition with the webcam. To use Simple Core recognition with python, the use of the OpenCV libraries is required. If in doubt about the installation, open the terminal and run this command.

# pip install opencv-python
